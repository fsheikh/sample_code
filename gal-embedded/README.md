# Embedded Software Challenge

We like to know how would you attack typical problems while developing embedded software.

Your challenge is to provide sample code for three independent tasks. This repository
contains a source file for each of the three tasks with instructions appearing as comments
in the respective files. You may also see some skeleton code for a task which you need to
complete based on the instructions given in the source file.

## Deliverables

- Sample code for Task 1, 2 and 3
- A Makefile which compiles complete programs for Task 1 and Task 2 with GNU C/C++ compiler
- For Task 3 the above Makefile should just compile the source file, complete program is not needed.
- Programs corresponding to Task 1 and Task 2 should be runable on a GNU/Linux PC such as a Ubuntu box.

## Time Limit

You have 90 minutes to complete these tasks.

## What we'll look at

- Structure of the code including flow and identifiable data structures
- Consistent code formatting
- Eye for writing efficient code suitable for running on constrained memory/cpu devices.

## Process

When you're ready, please fork this repository and start writing code in your fork. You'll get extra points for committing often in small chunks.
